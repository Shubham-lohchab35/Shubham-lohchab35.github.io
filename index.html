    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Shubham Lohchab, a passionate learner and aspiring computer scientist from India. My journey into coding began during a tough time in Class 10, when I was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. While recovering at home, I discovered programming and game development, which soon became my purpose. I’ve since taught myself C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and created games using Unity and Godot. Now in Class 12, I’m preparing to apply to top universities like MIT for the Class of 2026. I believe challenges shape us—and I’m proud of how far I’ve come. Also participating in the August 2025 GMTK & Brackey's GameJam>

  <section id="journey">
    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      In class 10, something happened that changed my life forever. I was diagnosed with <strong>liver cirrhosis</strong>. At that time, I didn’t even fully understand what it meant. All I knew was that I was very sick and had to stop going to school regularly. While other students were busy preparing for board exams, I was visiting hospitals and doctors.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, it was very hard. I was weak, tired all the time, and couldn’t eat many foods. My family was worried, and I felt scared. It was not easy to stay positive when my body didn’t support me. I missed classes, friends, and the normal teenage life. Sometimes, I would feel like I was falling behind in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But slowly, I started to fight back. I realized that even if I couldn’t go to school every day, I could still learn. During this time, my curiosity in games turned into a passion. I had always enjoyed playing games, but now I wanted to understand how they were made. I began learning programming through YouTube and MIT OpenCourseWare. At first, it was difficult for me to understand how things worked. The logic, the code, and the errors often confused me. But I didn’t give up. Day by day, I kept learning, practicing, and improving. I started with Python, then moved on to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After that, I explored C#—which became my main language for game development. Later, during my summer break in 2025, I started exploring game engines like Unity and Godot, and in 2024, I began creating my own games. I made a GTA-style open-world game, a Tekken-style fighting game, and even a 3D endless racing game. Making games gave me joy, purpose, and strength during a difficult time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, I not only got better at managing my health, but also found new goals in life. I want to become a computer scientist, and I’m now in class 12th preparing to apply for admission to the Class of 2026 at top universities like MIT. My illness taught me patience, courage, and self-discipline. It showed me how to stay focused even when life doesn’t go as planned.
    </p>
    <p>
    This journey through liver cirrhosis changed me. It made me stronger, more determined, and more thankful for every small thing. Today, I look back and feel proud of how far I’ve come.
