    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a self-driven student from India, applying to MIT in Early Action 2025. I love solving problems and building things—especially games and websites. I’m currently preparing to take the SAT in October 2025 and have been on a journey of deep self-growth, both academically and personally.

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      During the pandemic, I spent a lot of time playing computer games. That’s where my curiosity about how games are made began—but it was just casual interest at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The turning point came in 10th grade, when I was diagnosed with <strong>severe liver cirrhosis</strong>. I was home-locked for many weeks, undergoing intense treatment and heavy medications. During those isolating days, computers became more than just entertainment—they became my escape, my teacher, and eventually my purpose. I started watching tutorials, learning to code, and building small things from scratch. That’s when I realized this wasn’t just a distraction—it was my passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until Class 9, I wasn’t interested in mathematics either. But something changed that year—a great teacher, perhaps, or the joy of solving tough problems. I began enjoying math and even started helping my friends with their math and social studies homework. That experience gave me confidence and a sense of purpose in helping others too.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey has had both failures and wins: medical struggles, academic interruptions, emotional lows—but also personal projects, recovered motivation, tutoring friends, and self-learning. Each failure taught me something. Each achievement gave me hope.
